## Vocabulary

The file or document is a **spreadsheet**. It is uniquely identified by a `fileId` (Drive API speak) or a `spreadsheetId` (Sheets API speak).

A spreadsheet contains one or more **sheets**. In normal life, people also say "worksheet" or "tab". But not us. We say "sheet".

To connect back to Excel, a workbook = a spreadsheet = (xlsx) a SpreadsheetML package. It contains at least one sheet.
