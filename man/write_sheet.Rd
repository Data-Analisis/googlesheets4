\title{(Over)write new data into an existing sheet}
\usage{
write_sheet(data, ss, sheet = NULL, skip = 0)

sheets_write(data, ss, sheet = NULL, skip = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{ss}{Something that identifies a Google Sheet: its file ID, a URL from
which we can recover the ID, an instance of \code{googlesheets4_spreadsheet}
(returned by \code{\link[=sheets_get]{sheets_get()}}, or a \code{\link[googledrive:dribble]{dribble}}, which
is how googledrive represents Drive files. Processed through
\code{\link[=as_sheets_id]{as_sheets_id()}}.}

\item{sheet}{Sheet to write into, as in "worksheet" or "tab". Either a string
(the name of a sheet), or an integer (the position of the sheet). If
unspecified, defaults to the first sheet.}

\item{skip}{Number of rows to leave empty before starting to write.}
}
\value{
Updated metadata for the (spread)Sheet \code{ss}, as an instance of S3
class \code{googlesheets4_spreadsheet}.
}
\description{
\lifecycle{experimental}

Updates an existing (work)sheet in an existing (spread)Sheet with a data
frame. All pre-existing values, formats, and dimensions of the targeted sheet
are cleared and it gets its new values and dimensions from \code{data}. Special
formatting is applied to the header row, which holds column names, and the
first \code{skip + 1} rows are frozen (so, up to and including the header row).
