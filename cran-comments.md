CRAN Review: 2019-10-22

The reviewer asked for more details in the description and to explain all acronyms. I have added:

  * An explanation that API = "application programming interface" and a
    description of what that means.
  * An explanation that v4 = "version 4" of the Sheets API.
  * A statement that googlesheets4 lets a user retrieve metadata and data
    out of a Google Sheet.
