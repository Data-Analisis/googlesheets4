Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, please don't use this form. Instead, ask on <https://stackoverflow.com/> or <https://community.rstudio.com/>.

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.
Special tricks for this package are in [How to create a googlesheets4 reprex](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/googlesheets4-reprex.html).
